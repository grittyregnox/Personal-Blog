# Personal-Blog
My personal blog

The past few days haven’t been very easy.
I wake up hoping it’ll feel different, but it never does.
I smile when I’m supposed to, talk when I have to — but it’s all empty.
Even when I’m surrounded, I feel like I’m not really there.
I don’t know how much longer I can pretend everything’s fine.

But anyways, I’ve been listening to music again.
Just for a while, it quiets the noise in my head.
It doesn’t fix anything, but it feels... less heavy.
