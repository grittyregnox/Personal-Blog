# Personal-Blog
My personal blog

The past few days haven’t been very easy.
I wake up hoping it’ll feel different, but it never does.
I smile when I’m supposed to, talk when I have to — but it’s all empty.
Even when I’m surrounded, I feel like I’m not really there.
I don’t know how much longer I can pretend everything’s fine.

I'll be posting these blogs on my website soon (yet to be created).
